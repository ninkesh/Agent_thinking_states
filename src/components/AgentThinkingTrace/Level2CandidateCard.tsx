/** One card, one stable DOM identity for the item's whole lifetime
 *  (discovered -> enriched -> negated -> shortlisted/removed -> promoted ->

 *  child rows driven by `state`/`metadata`/`importance` rather than swapping
 *  in a different component per state, so the card reads as "learning more,"
 *  not "being replaced." All transition timing (including size/position) is
 *  CSS (state class change), never a per-card timer.
 *
 *  This is also the SAME component used for the crystallized final answer —
 *  see `importance === 'resolved'`. There is no separate "result card"
 *  component: once the promoted candidate resolves, this exact node just
 *  gains a CTA row (reusing L1's own FocusButton/DotsIcon/HeartIcon, not an
 *  invented style) rather than the app swapping to a different visual tree.
 *
 *  `importance` (see src/adapters/cardImportance.ts) is the single source of
 *  truth for CONTENT DENSITY — which optional rows render — and is a
 *  separate axis from `item.state` (which drives the emphasis styling:
 *  border/glow/scale, unchanged below) and from `crystallized`/`focused`
 *  (phase-level rail sizing / TV remote-nav ring, neither of which is a
 *  content-density concern).
 *
 *  Deliberately mixes several signals beyond size — border/glow emphasis,
 *  opacity/saturation, and a typographic split between FACT (travel time,
 *  rating, price, availability — plain, light color), EVIDENCE (short data
 *  bullets — quiet, joined into one line) and JUDGMENT (the agent's own
 *  concluding read — bold, uppercase, accent-colored) — so "why this card
 *  matters" doesn't rely on "is it bigger than the others."
 *
 *  Every value below is `key`-ed by its own content, not just conditionally
 *  rendered — a row that's already on screen (e.g. `judgment` going from
 *  "GOOD BALANCE" to "BEST OVERALL WEEKEND FIT" at PROMOTE) still needs a
 *  fresh DOM node to replay its shimmer-in when the *value* changes, not
 *  just the first time it appears.
 *
 *  On top of that, `changeSignature` below fingerprints the item's whole
 *  state+metadata so the CARD ITSELF (not just the one line that changed)
 *  gets a full-surface shimmer sweep every time anything about it updates —
 *  a single per-line shimmer was too easy to miss ("is this still working,
 *  or done?"); a full-card sweep at a longer, clearly-visible duration
 *  isn't. */
