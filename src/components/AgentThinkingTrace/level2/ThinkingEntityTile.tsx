   LEVEL 2 — ThinkingEntityTile.

   The ONE reusable entity treatment for the thinking phase. Deliberately
   lightweight: image (when one genuinely exists), title, and the facts learned
   so far. No CTA, no description, no address, no recommendation copy — those
   belong to the final response, which is an existing L1 template, not a bigger
   version of this tile.

   STATE VOCABULARY — each state means one thing, and the motion says it:

     neutral      in play                          scale 1.00
     considering  being weighed right now          scale 1.03, border lifts
     strong       pulling ahead                    scale 1.10, border + glow
     receding     outweighed, still visible        scale 0.90, opacity down

   There is deliberately NO hero/promoted state. During thinking the agent is
   searching, learning, comparing and narrowing — the dramatic hierarchy
   belongs to the final L1 result, which owns the answer. A card that takes
   over the screen here would make the final response an anticlimax and would
   claim a decision the thinking phase has not made.

   Scale is applied to a wrapper that also owns real WIDTH, so a growing tile
   reflows its neighbours instead of painting over them — see the canvas.

   COMPARISON MODE is a fifth thing this tile can be doing, orthogonal to the
   four states above. It changes what the tile SHOWS, not what it means:

     the media frame stays exactly where it is and recedes (never re-cropped,
     never re-fetched, never unmounted — image identity has to be stable or
     the viewer loses track of which card is which)

     the title stays exactly where it is, at full strength

     the FACT PLANE — and only the fact plane — turns over, swapping the
     learned-metadata row for one dimension's label and value

   Both faces of the plane are mounted permanently and stacked in one grid
   cell, so the plane's height is the taller of the two and the card geometry
   never moves between modes. The turn is a shallow ~10° rotateY with the
   opacity crossfade timed to the midpoint, not a card flip: the point is
   "this surface is being turned over to show you something", not a reveal.
